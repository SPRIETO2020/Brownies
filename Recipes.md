First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.
Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. (Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top.)
Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper.
Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes.
